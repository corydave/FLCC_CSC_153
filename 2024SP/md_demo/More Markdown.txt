Sometimes it's important not to break a reader's flow by redirecting them away from your markdown document when they click on a link. In this case, such links should open up in a different tab in their browser, unfortunately, the commonMark [â†—] document which is a specification for the Markdown syntax does not describe a way to implement this.
